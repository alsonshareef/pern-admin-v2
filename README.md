# Teacher Administration Application

## About

This web application provides teachers a way to keep track of students and to carry out administrative tasks in regards to them such as registrations and suspensions, as well as a way to communicate with students through notifications which students can view on their homepage.

&#8594; Teachers will be able to do the following:

- Create an account to then be redirected to their teacher homepage that will display all their registered students and access to all administrative features.
- Register a specified list of students to a specified list of teachers.
- Unregister a specified list of students from a specified list of teachers.
- Retrieve a list of registered students that are common between a specified list of teachers.
- Suspend a specified list of students which will stop them from being able to receive messages from teachers, but they will remain registered to their respective teachers unless a teacher decides they should be unregistered completely.
- Send messages to students that have to satisfy the following:
  - are **NOT** suspended.
  - are either registered to them **OR** have been @mentioned.

&#8594; Students will be able to do the following:

- Create an account which they will be able to log into and see which teachers they have been registered to.
- View whether they have been either been suspended or unregistered from one or multiple teachers.
- View messages that they have received from teachers they are registered to or by teachers who have @mentioned them (in the case they are not suspended).

## Motivation

- Setting up a relational database to fulfill CRUD operations as well as to show knowledge of writing SQL queries.
- How to utilize Authentication and Authorization to expose different types of users to different functionality.
- How to utilise a design pattern such as MVC to add structure and modularity to the backend code so it is easier to maintain.
- How to create a user-friendly UI using React.
